# Implementation Strategies
## Project Structure
Followed Sveltekit's conventions as per their documentation.
## Rendering
Since this is a static application, I disabled Server Side Rendering and enabled Prerender.
## Data Storage
Used localStorage to store the pin location.
Add functionality to data stores to automatically update localStorage whenever the pin location changes.
